# Gravity Simulation

###  Project plan:

Make a ball that are bouncing. When two balls are bouncing, they should be able to bounce from each other as well.

Then, make the behave like planets with gravity, so when a ball is shot against another, it should be like a "graviational" slingshot.

Make the ball look 3D using vertices? 

Add the physical behavoir of a planet and the sun. 

Maybe add space curvature???
